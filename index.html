        <h2>What is the Internet?</h2>

        <p>The Internet is like a massive web of connected computers and servers that talk to each other. It lets people all over the world share information, from emails to videos, almost instantly. When you visit a website or send a message, your device reaches out through this web, grabs what you need, and brings it back to you. Think of it like a giant library thatâ€™s open 24/7, with infinite shelves of knowledge and entertainment.</p>
