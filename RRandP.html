Routers act like traffic directors, figuring out the best path for data to travel. Packets are the small chunks of data that make up whatever you’re sending or receiving, like splitting a puzzle into pieces to send it and then putting it back together when it arrives. Redundancy is the backup system that ensures if one route has issues, there’s another way for the data to get through. And when packets get dropped or lost the system resends them or adjusts to make sure everything arrives in the end. That’s how the internet keeps things working even when it messes up.</P>
